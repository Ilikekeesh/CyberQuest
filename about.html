        <p>
            <b>CyberQuest</b> is a project made to address the need for easy-to-understand, high-school level content for cybersecurity and cryptography. AP Cybersecurity is a brand new class, and a lot of teachers might feel underprepared with a brand-new curriculum. When we surveyed our own AP Cybersecurity class, 70% of students rated their prior knowledge of cybersecurity at either a 1 or 2 out of 5. This told us there was a need for this class to exist and do well, but that can be difficult without good resources, which we seek to provide to teachers and students.

            <b>Team Phishify</b> is a team of Harry De Reu, Charlie Dyvig, and Rheya Ravishankar. We thank our amazing teacher Mr. Brigham French for helping us make this project real and believing in us.
